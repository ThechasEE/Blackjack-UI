# Blackjack-UI

Blackjack game with a furry theme! I decided to make this over the summer of 2020 as a way to learn the C# language as well as get experience using Git, the Visual Studio IDE, and the WPF framework.

Features two gamemodes (Freestyle and Challenge)
- Freestyle: Done
- Challenge: In progress
